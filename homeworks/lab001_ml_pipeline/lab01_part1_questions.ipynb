        "2) FALSE  This is false because of the word \"always.\" Sure, 1-NN usually has 0 training error because it just memorizes the data. But 5-NN can also have 0 error if the groups are clearly separated. Since they can be equal (both 0), saying 1-NN is strictly \"lower\" isn't right.\n",
        "3) FALSE  Actually, it's usually the opposite. 1-NN overfits really badly, it picks up on all the noise and outliers. 5-NN is smoother because it averages things out, so it usually works better on new test data (lower error), not worse.\n",
        "4) TRUE  $k$-NN is a \"lazy\" algorithm, it doesn't really learn a model beforehand. When you want to classify a new point, it has to compare that point to every single training image to find the distance. So, if you double the number of training images ($N$), you have to do double the work. That means the time grows linearly, or $O(N)$.\n",
